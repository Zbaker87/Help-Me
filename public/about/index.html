      <p>My research program uses an integrative approach to explore how environmental factors affect the morphology, performance, and behavior of biological organisms. I integrate laboratory and field-based methods rooted in biology, with analytical and theoretical methods from physics, chemistry, and material science. Currently I use ants and geckos to explore questions about the functional morphology of adhesion. I have three major areas of interest: 1. Research on the adhesive systems of ants and geckos has principally focused the physical mechanism of adhesion. However, this has left gaps in our understanding of the chemical, material, and morphological characteristics of these systems. My collaborators and I fill these gaps using techniques such as mass spectrometry, NMR, and SEM. 2. Most biological adhesive systems are tested in controlled laboratory conditions. However, this approach often neglects whole organism performance, behavior, and relevant abiotic and biotic environmental factors. To address these complex interactions, I test static and dynamic adhesion of live ants and geckos in a variety of ecologically relevant conditions in the laboratory and in the field. I use these results to make predictions and test questions about the behavior, ecology, and evolution of these systems. 3. I am interested in the application of bio-inspired design and biomimicry to real-world problems. I apply the insights I glean from the mechanistic, performance, and behavioral attributes of natural adhesive systems to synthetic adhesive systems. I also find that focus on application provides important opportunities for collaboration within and outside of academia, interdisciplinary education, and service.</p>
